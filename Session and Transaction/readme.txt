The status column in SQL Server indicates the current state of a session or request. It tells you what the session is doing at any given moment. To make it easier to understand, let's break down each of the possible statuses with real-life examples:

1. Background
What it means: Sessions in this state are typically performing internal maintenance tasks that aren’t directly related to user queries. These are often housekeeping activities, like automatic cleanup or background processes that SQL Server runs.
Real-life example: Imagine you’re using an app to shop online, and the app is updating its product catalog in the background while you’re browsing. You don’t see these updates happening, but they are essential for keeping the system running smoothly.
2. Rollback
What it means: When a session is in "rollback" status, it means that a transaction is being undone. This happens when a session is forced to abort or “rollback” a change after performing a data modification operation, like an update or delete. If you manually stop a session (e.g., by using KILL), the changes made by that session are rolled back to ensure that the data remains consistent.
Real-life example: Suppose you are filling out a lengthy online form, and you accidentally press the "back" button. The form rolls back to its previous state, undoing the data you entered. Similarly, in SQL Server, if a session is interrupted, any changes it made will be undone during the rollback process.
3. Running
What it means: A session in the "running" status is actively executing a query and consuming CPU resources. It means the session is in the middle of processing and isn’t waiting for anything else, such as input or resources. The query is actively working on the CPU without yielding control back to the operating system.
Real-life example: Think of this like a delivery truck driving down the highway. The truck (the query) is actively moving and not stopping or waiting for anything—it’s fully operational. The server is actively processing the request without interruptions.
4. Runnable
What it means: A session that is "runnable" is waiting for its turn to use the CPU. It’s like the session is ready to go but needs to wait its turn in the queue, as the CPU is currently being used by another process. SQL Server manages this by giving each query a fair share of CPU time to prevent any single query from monopolizing it.
Real-life example: Imagine you are in a busy coffee shop, and there’s a line at the counter. You’re ready to order, but you have to wait until the customer ahead of you is done. Similarly, a "runnable" session is ready to execute but must wait for the CPU to be free.
5. Sleeping
What it means: A "sleeping" session is idle—it’s not actively doing anything at the moment. This usually happens when there’s no current work for the session to process, which is common in connection pooling. These sessions are waiting for new work to come in, but they’re not actively using the system resources.
Real-life example: This is like a worker sitting at a desk, waiting for the next task. The worker is not actively working, but they’re ready when something new comes in. If the worker is "sleeping" too long, it may be because they’re waiting on someone to give them a task.
6. Suspended
What it means: A "suspended" session is waiting for some resource before it can proceed. For example, it might be waiting for a lock to be released, waiting for data from disk (I/O), or waiting for available memory. The session is still running but cannot continue because it’s blocked or has to wait for something external.
Real-life example: Imagine you're waiting for a specific piece of information before you can make a decision. For instance, you're waiting for a delivery truck to arrive so you can complete the installation of a piece of equipment. Until the truck arrives (in this case, the resource is available), you can't continue with your work. In SQL Server, a session in the suspended state is waiting for a resource to become available before it can resume execution.
Why Does This Matter?
The status column is helpful when diagnosing performance issues. If many sessions are "runnable", it might indicate that the CPU is under heavy load, and the server may need more processing power. If sessions are "suspended" for long periods, it could point to underlying issues like lock contention, disk I/O problems, or resource allocation issues.

By understanding the different states, database administrators can identify problems, like:

CPU overuse (too many runnable sessions)
Inefficient queries or locking issues (long-running suspended sessions)
Potentially stalled transactions (rollback state)
In summary, the status column serves as an important diagnostic tool to help you understand what’s going on with your database sessions and ensure everything is running smoothly.
